  Two &nbsp roads &nbsp diverged &nbsp in &nbsp a &nbsp yellow &nbsp wood,<br><br><br>
  And &nbsp be &nbsp one &nbsp traveler, &nbsp long &nbsp I &nbsp stood<br><br><br>
  And &nbsp looked &nbsp down &nbsp one &nbsp as &nbsp far &nbsp as &nbsp I &nbsp could<br><br><br>
  To &nbsp where &nbsp it &nbsp bent &nbsp in &nbsp the &nbsp undergrowth;
  <br><br>
</p>

<p class="secondstanza"> 
  Then &nbsp&nbsp took &nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp other, &nbsp&nbsp as &nbsp&nbsp just &nbsp&nbsp as &nbsp&nbsp fair,<br><br><br><br>
  And &nbsp&nbsp having &nbsp&nbsp perhaps &nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp better &nbsp&nbsp claim,<br><br><br><br>
  Because &nbsp&nbsp it &nbsp&nbsp was &nbsp&nbsp grassy &nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp wanted &nbsp&nbsp wear;<br><br><br><br>
  Though &nbsp&nbsp as &nbsp&nbsp for &nbsp&nbsp that &nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp passing &nbsp&nbsp there<br><br><br><br>
  Had &nbsp&nbsp worn &nbsp&nbsp them &nbsp&nbsp really &nbsp&nbsp about &nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp same,
  <br><br><br>
</p>

<p class="thirdstanza">
  And &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp both &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp that &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp morning &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp equally &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp lay<br><br><br><br><br>
  In &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp leaves &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp no &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp step &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp had &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp trodden &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp black.<br><br><br><br><br>
  Oh, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp kept &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp first &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp for &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp another &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp day!<br><br><br><br><br>
  Yet &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp knowing &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp how &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp way &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp leads &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp on &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp way,<br><br><br><br><br>
  I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp doubted &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp if &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp should &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ever &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp come &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp back.
  <br><br><br><br>
</p>

<p class="fourthstanza">
  I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp shall &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp be &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp telling &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp this &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp with &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp sigh<br><br><br><br><br><br>
  Somewhere &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ages &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ages &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp hence:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
  Two &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp roads &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp diverged &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp in &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp wood, &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Iâ€”<br><br><br><br><br><br>
  I &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp took &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp one less &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp traveled &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp by,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
  And &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp that &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp has &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp made all &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp difference.
