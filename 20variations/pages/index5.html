  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd be one traveler, long I stood<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd looked down one as far as I could<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo where it bent in the undergrowth;
</p>

<p class="secondstanza">
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThen took the other, as just as fair,<br><br><br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd having perhaps the better claim,<br><br><br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;<br><br><br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThough as for that the passing there<br><br><br>
   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHad worn them really about the same,
</p>

<p class="thirdstanza">
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd both that morning equally lay<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn leaves no step had trodden black.<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOh, I kept the first for another day!<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYet knowing how way leads on to way,<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI doubted if I should ever come back.
</p>

<p class="fourthstanza">
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI shall be telling this with a sigh<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSomewhere ages and ages hence:<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTwo roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI took the one less traveled by,<br><br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd that has made all the difference.
