<p class="firststanza">
  <span id="one">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br></span>
  <span id="one">And be one traveler, long I stood<br></span>
  <span id="one">And looked down one as far as I could<br></span>
  <span id="one">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</span>
</p>



<p class="secondstanza">
  <span id="one">Then took the other, as just as fair,<br></span>
  
  <span id="one">And having perhaps the better claim,<br></span>
  <span id="one">Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br></span>
  <span id="one">Though as for that the passing there<br></span>
  <span id="one">Had worn them really about the same,</span>
</p>



<p class="thirdstanza">
  <span id="one">And both that morning equally lay<br></span>
  <span id="one">In leaves no step had trodden black.<br></span>
  <span id="one">Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br></span>
  <span id="one">Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br></span>
  <span id="one">I doubted if I should ever come back.</span>

<p class="fourthstanza">
  <span id="one">I shall be telling this with a sigh<br></span>
  <span id="one">Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br></span>
  <span id="one">Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br></span>
  <span id="one">I took the one less traveled by,<br></span>
  <span id="one">And that has made all the difference.</span>
