  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br><br> 
  And be one traveler, long I stood<br><br> 
  And looked down one as far as I could<br><br> 
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;>>

  Then took the other, as just as fair,<br><br> 
  And having perhaps the better claim,<br><br> 
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br><br> 
  Though as for that the passing there<br><br> 
  Had worn them really about the same,>>

  And both that morning equally lay<br><br> 
  In leaves no step had trodden black.<br><br> 
  Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br><br> 
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br><br> 
  I doubted if I should ever come back.>>

  I took the one less traveled by,<br><br> 
  And that has made all the difference.
