<h3> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
</h3>
<ol class="firststanza">
  <li>And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
  </li>
  <li id="line1">And looked down one as far as I could<br>
  </li>
  <li>To where it bent in the undergrowth;
  </li>
</ol>

<h3> Then took the other, as just as fair,
</h3>
<ol class="secondstanza">
  <li>And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
  </li>
  <li id="line1">Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
  </li>
  <li>Though as for that the passing there
  </li>
  <li id="line2">Had worn them really about the same,
  </li>
</ol>
<h3> And both that morning equally lay
</h3>
<ol class="thirdstanza">
  <li>And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
  </li>
  <li id="line1">In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
  </li>
  <li id="line2">Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
  </li>
  <li>I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>I shall be telling this with a sigh
</h3>
<ol class="fourthstanza">
  <li>Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
  </li>
  <li id="line1">Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
  </li>
  <li>I took the one less traveled by,<br>
  </li>
  <li id="line2">And that has made all the difference.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
