<p class="firststanza">
  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
  And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
  And looked down one as far as I could<br>
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;
</p>

<p class="secondstanza">
  Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
  And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
  Though as for that the passing there<br>
  Had worn them really about the same,
</p>

<p class="thirdstanza">
  And both that morning equally lay<br>
  In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
  Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
  I doubted if I should ever come back.
</p>

<p class="fourthstanza">
  I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
  Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
  Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
  I took the one less traveled by,<br>
  And that has made all the difference.
