<li>What kind of site is it? Who is the audience?<br><br>
This is a fashion blog website. The audience is young people who are interested in fashion, and those who follow the creator, Avery Ginsberg.</li><br><br>

<li>What type of content does it feature; long-form text, slideshows, videos, etc?<br><br>
It features mostly galleries of photos, which then link to individual pages with write-ups.</li><br><br>

<li>What typefaces, type sizes and colors are used?<br><br>
Teal green and shades of gray. The typefaces are traditional.</li><br><br> 

<li>How would you describe it aesthetically? Beautiful, clunky, boring, sparse, packed, ugly? Why?<br><br> 
I would describe it as nostalgic and sparse. The website borrows the old windows 95 theme which for me seems old and static.</li><br><br> 

<li>How does the menu function?<br><br>
The menu is based off old windows 95 icons and link to the corresponding pages.</li><br><br> 

<li>What can you interpret about the org/person/group by what you see? Do you trust them, 
are you suspicious, ambivalent, etc?<br><br>
I think this is a very personal website and reveals a lot about the guy who created it. It’s a blog so it is supposed to be transparent in this way.</li><br><br> 

<li>What kind of tone does the website set: fun, serious, slick, corporate, DIY?<br><br>
I think it sets a tone of playfulness and does not take itself too seriously.</li> <br><br>


<li>Are there any surprises as you click around?</li><br><br>

<li>There are surprises when you click on some of the icons, because they don’t really tell you exactly what you will land on.</li><br><br> 


<li>Is there anything particularly annoying or confusing about it?<br><br>
The site is slightly confusing due to the fact that the whole thing is not integrated into the windows 95 concept.</li><br><br>
